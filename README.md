# modular-code-development

Modular code should exhibit the following:

_Separation of Concerns_: The code is organized into functions with clear responsibilities. Each function performs a specific task, such as temperature conversion or validation. This separation makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

_Reusability_: The individual temperature conversion functions (celsius_to_fahrenheit, fahrenheit_to_celsius, etc.) can be reused in other parts of your code or in different projects if needed. This enhances code reusability.

_Readability_: By giving meaningful names to functions and using comments, the code is more readable and self-documenting. Anyone reading the code can quickly grasp its purpose and how it works.

_Testing_: Because each function has a well-defined purpose, it becomes easier to write unit tests for them. This modular structure makes it simpler to validate the correctness of each component independently.

_Main Function_: The convert_temperature function serves as the entry point for the temperature conversion process. It handles unit validation, temperature validation, and the actual conversion logic.

_Conditional Handling_: The code uses conditional statements (if, elif, else) to determine the appropriate conversion based on the input unit. This keeps the logic clean and organized.

_Error Handling_: The code includes error handling for cases where the input unit or temperature is invalid. It returns informative error messages in such cases, which is good practice for user-friendly error reporting.

_Main Function Call_: The if __name__ == "__main__": block at the end of the code demonstrates how to use the convert_temperature function by providing sample inputs and printing the results. This is a common way to test the functionality of your code.
