# Modular code development
#### Timing
2:00 hours

### Instructor Notes
Use [these slides](../content/04-modular-code/index.html) to explain the topic of modular code development.

The [code refinery instructor guide](https://coderefinery.github.io/modular-type-along/instructor-guide/)
can be followed to interactively make a piece more modular. Alternatively, there is an exercise in the [exercise document](../content/excercises-document.md) on extracting functions from an awful piece of ChatGPT-generated nested code that can be done.
