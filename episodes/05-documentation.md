# Documentation
#### Timing
1:00 hour

### Instructor notes
The main purpose of this lesson is to make sure participants understand that DOCUMENTATION IS IMPORTANT. 
The goal is more to trigger participants then to teach them all the different ways one could document a project.
It is good to communicate this (and that this will give more time for the other parts of the workshop).

We usually follow 
[A lesson with a focus on in-code-documentation and readme files](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/guide/#a-lesson-with-a-focus-on-in-code-documentation-and-readme-files). 
It is also suggested to do the ‘write a README file for an example project’ exercise interactively 
(I.e. participants make suggestions and instructor writes the readme file).

You can use [these slides](../files/05-code-documentation-slides.pptx) as a guideline.
