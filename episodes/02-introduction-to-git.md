# Introduction to git
#### Timing
3:12 hours (this is according to the carpentries, but it is not accurate, see below)

### Instructor Notes
Lesson material: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
Slides (optional, but nice and helpful to show): https://nlesc-slides.github.io/2023-06-19-ds-cr/git/. This is our suggestion for when to use the slides:
- Slides 0 - 4: accompanying episode 1 (Automated Version Control)
- Slides 5 - 9: right after episode 4 (Tracking Changes)

NB: Optional day before the course starts for participants who donâ€™t know the git basics yet.

Teach what you think is most useful. See how far you get, usually we get to episode 7 in one morning.
To give participants a good understanding of the git basics, we suggest to:
* Ignore the temptation to answer advanced questions. (You can of course do this individually during exercises).
* Explain what a command line is, why it is useful, and why we use it in this workshop. Participants are often new to the command line and don't get why we not use a git gui.
* Only focus on the bare essentials for setting up git ([episode 2](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/index.html)
* Do episode 5 (exploring history) as a demo and do not go into the details. The aim is to demonstrate to participants the **possiblity** to go back and forth through the git log, which is enough for an introduction to git. In practice you only use this occasionally.
* Focus on the main concept of ignoring files with a `.gitignore` file, instead of fully learning the syntax. ([episode 6](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/06-ignore/index.html)
* Take a dedicated moment right before [episode 7](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github/index.html) to check succesful completion of particpants' SSH setup and help out people who did not succeed yet. You will need 15-30 minutes for this.
* Make use of `git switch` and `git restore` instead of the confusing `git checkout`. This is probably much clearer for participants. We haven't tried this yet and it is not in the training material, so you have to do some pioneering.

You can use [these slides to introduce git](../files/02-introduction-to-git-slides.pptx)
You can skip [the lesson on collaborating](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/08-collab/index.html),
since we cover that extensively in the rest of the course.
