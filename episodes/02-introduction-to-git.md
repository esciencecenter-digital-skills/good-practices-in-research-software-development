# Introduction to git
#### Timing
3:12 hours (this is according to the carpentries, but it is not accurate, see below)

### Instructor Notes
Lesson material: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/ 

NB: Optional day before the course starts for participants who donâ€™t know the git basics yet.

Teach what you think is most useful. See how far you get, usually we get to episode 7 in one morning.
To give participants a good understanding of the git basics, we suggest to:
* Ignore the temptation to answer advanced questions. (You can of course do this individually during exercises).
* Only focus on the bare essentials for setting up git ([episode 2](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/index.html)
* Focus on the main concept of ignoring files with a `.gitignore` file, instead of fully learning the syntax. ([episode 6](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/06-ignore/index.html)
* Take a dedicated moment right before [episode 7](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github/index.html) to check succesful completion of particpants' SSH setup and help out people who did not succeed yet. You will need 15-30 minutes for this.

You can use [these slides to introduce git](../files/02-introduction-to-git-slides.pptx)
You can skip [the lesson on collaborating](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/08-collab/index.html),
since we cover that extensively in the rest of the course.
