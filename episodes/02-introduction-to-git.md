# Introduction to git
Lesson material: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/ 

NB: Optional day before the course starts for participants who donâ€™t know the git basics yet.

Teach what you think is most useful. See how far you get.
You can use [these slides to introduce git](../files/02-introduction-to-git-slides.pptx)
You can skip [the lesson on collaborating](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/08-collab/index.html),
since we cover that extensively in the rest of the course.
